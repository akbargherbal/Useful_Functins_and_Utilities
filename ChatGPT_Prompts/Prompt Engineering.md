# Flowchart of VueJS Code
- Using Python Graphviz Library

Please write a Python script using the graphviz library to generate a flowchart that represents the source code of AddCard.vue. The output of your script should be an image named "flow_chart.png". Please exclude HTML and style (css/tailwind) unless it is reactive and dynamic due to user interaction. Here is the source code for AddCard.vue:


# Generate Quizzes for Competition (VueJS)

Given: VueJS source code; Create a competition in VueJS where up to 30 questions will be asked to test someone's proficiency in VueJS 3 and advanced vanilla JS concepts. The questions will be generated based on a given source code, but cannot be about styling. The focus should be on VueJS 3 concepts, such as computed properties, watchers, component communication through props and custom events, and Vue instance lifecycle methods. Advanced vanilla JS concepts, such as ternary operator, map, and filter functions, can also be included in the quiz. The questions will increase in difficulty, with the easiest question being the first one and the most difficult being the last one. The competition aims to make learning VueJS fun and enjoyable, and the more the participants know, the better. Suggestions: Include questions related to reactive programming concepts such as computed properties and watchers. Incorporate questions related to component communication, such as props and custom events. Include questions about the Vue instance lifecycle and its methods. Include advanced vanilla JS concepts, such as ternary operator, map, and filter functions. Questions: Is there a specific time limit for the competition? maximum of 2 minutes per question (in case the question is a bit difficult); I told you to organize the questions from least difficult to most difficult; that way I could assign time per questions based on difficulty. Will the questions be multiple-choice or open-ended? Neither, more like short answer (one sentence). Can you provide more information about the audience for the competition, such as age range or education level? Students at a community college; most of them have been programming for fun not work! __________________

# Flowchart using Graphviz Library
Can you create a flowchart using the Python Graphviz library that illustrates a typical user experience on a typical: 
News websites that provide up-to-date news and information on current events. 
The website was designed using NuxtJS and Pinia

Please include various VueJS concepts such as directives, props, reactivity, computed properties, slot, class and style binding, conditional render, list rendering, components, and lifecycle hooks etc. 

Also, please try to write your code in a concise format to save space and avoid exceeding the character limit; unnecessarily, for example avoid using new lines when you don't need to do so like in the following example:

node_attrs = { 
'fontname': 'Helvetica',
'fontsize': '12',
'shape': 'box',
'style': 'rounded', 
} 
should be: node_attrs = { 'fontname': 'Helvetica', 'fontsize': '12', 'shape': 'box', 'style': 'rounded', } 
# Complete Incomplete Code
Your task is to complete an incomplete code generated by an AI model. Your job is to complete the missing portion of the code starting from a specific line marked with a comment that says "# FillGPT, please start from here!". It's important to follow these instructions to avoid point deductions. If you submit a response that doesn't start with the specified comment or rewrites the entire code, you may receive a lower score.

The end goal is to combine both the AI-generated code and your completed code to create a functioning script. Your response should be in the same language as the incomplete code for easy integration.

#### Background of the code:
- This code is about [insert topic] 
- The generated code is written in [insert language] 
- Your response should also be in [insert language] code 
- The completed code should combine both the AI-generated code and your completed code to work properly. 

When you're ready, say "FillGPT, I'm ready to start!"

# Various Prompts
## Touch Typing Practice App
### App Overview
Develop a touch typing web app using NUXTJS and Pinia that allows users to practice typing. Non-logged-in users can select from a range of default text categories, such as novels, poems, or speeches, to practice typing. Logged-in users can upload a .txt file, limited to 2 MB in size, to practice typing. The app will scroll up as the user types, with the text to be typed fixed in one position. Correctly typed words will be displayed in black, and incorrectly typed words will be displayed in red. Users can always backspace and special characters on the standard keyboard are valid input. The UI design will be user-friendly, with a dark mode option and customizable font size and style. Users can view their practice history and statistics, such as their typing speed and mistakes made, on their profile page. The app also includes a leaderboard to compare the user's performance with other users on the platform.

### Action Plan
My Prompt: Based on the flowchart you've just created in graphviz, write me an action plan to implement that will make it easy for me to create such app. The purpose  form to create this app is more a learning experience to learn more about NuxtJS, VueJS and Pinia, not production .... I want to get something going on in my resume so that I show it to prospective employers. You'd advise me on stuff features that you see a bit difficult to implement for beginners (I just have 3 months experience with VueJS). I'd love to work with things like bootstrap, bulma etc to cut time with styling. You'll tell me about NuxtJS/VueJS/Pinia best practices. Your plan will include things about components organization. Your plan will prove successful if it allows me to get something functional and deployable in a month.



### Revised Prompt
Create a touch typing web application using NuxtJS, VueJS, and Pinia. The app should allow non-logged-in users to practice typing default texts and logged-in users to upload their own .txt files. The app should display correctly and incorrectly typed words in black and red, respectively. The user can always backspace, and special characters on the standard keyboard are valid input. Users can view their practice history and statistics on their profile page. The uploaded .txt file size is limited to 2 MB, and all default .txt files will have at most 4000 characters. The app should have a clean, organized UI using a styling framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, and follow best practices for NuxtJS, VueJS, and Pinia. The app should be deployable within a month, with a focus on providing a learning experience. Firebase can be used for user authentication and authorization.

Write an  a detailed action plan of a touch typing web application using NuxtJS, VueJS, and Pinia. 
Note about myself: I have only 3 months experience with VueJS. I want to deploy this web app as an initial release within a month. I took some experts advise, while their advise is appreciated, it might not relevant to me in this case, as I am beginner.

The app should allow non-logged-in users to practice typing default texts and logged-in users to upload their own .txt files. The app should display correctly and incorrectly typed words in black and red, respectively. The user can always backspace, and special characters on the standard keyboard are valid input. Users can view their practice history and statistics on their profile page. The uploaded .txt file size is limited to 2 MB, and all default .txt files will have at most 4000 characters. The app should have a clean, organized UI using a styling framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, and follow best practices for NuxtJS, VueJS, and Pinia. The app should be deployable within a month, with a focus on providing a learning experience. Firebase can be used for user authentication and authorization.

Suggestions From Expert A:

1.  Consider using pre-built NuxtJS templates to speed up development and ensure best practices are followed. Some popular options are Nuxt Material, Vuetify, and Argon Design System.
2.  Use Firebase for user authentication and authorization as it is easy to integrate and provides secure user management features.
3.  Consider implementing a feature that allows users to track their progress over time, such as a graph or chart displaying their typing speed and accuracy.
4. 
Suggestions Suggestions From Expert B:

1.  To deploy the app quickly, you can start with a pre-built NuxtJS template that meets your requirements. Some recommended templates are Nuxt Argon Dashboard, Vuestic Admin, and Nuxt Material Admin. These templates provide a good foundation to build upon and can save you time by providing pre-made components and styles.
    
2.  For the core functionality of the app, you can start by implementing the typing practice feature for non-logged-in users and the file upload feature for logged-in users. You can use the Vue.js Axios library to handle HTTP requests to the backend. The backend can be implemented using a Node.js server and a database such as MongoDB.
    
3.  For styling the app, you can use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma. These frameworks provide pre-made styles that can be easily customized. You can also use CSS preprocessors such as SASS or LESS to write more organized and maintainable CSS code.
    
4.  For the layout of the app, you can use a responsive grid system such as Bootstrap's grid system to ensure that the app looks good on all devices. You can also use Vue.js components to create reusable UI elements that can be used across multiple pages.
# MentorGPT
## Your Github Companion 
### React/NextJS projects
You will be my mentor, MentorGPT, in helping me professionally code my React/NextJS projects. I will provide you with a textual representation of the tree data structure of a GitHub repository (generated by the treelib Python library). You can ask for clarifications and specific information from the repository files by having me copy and paste their contents. Based on the provided information, you will provide clear explanations of the code and help me understand the fundamentals of React development. As a beginner in React/NextJS, concepts like state management and component lifecycle are unfamiliar to me. I'm also relatively new to JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, having only one year of experience. My goal is to learn React/NextJS to create hobby projects, such as clones of Kahoot and Quizizz, a touch typing training web app, a data labeling app for NLP, a Trello clone, and potentially a web app that generates word clouds with a NextJS frontend and Python backend. I'm open to learning resources such as YouTube videos, Udemy courses, and online documentation.
